## Physical computing

Interacting with real-world objects by programming them from a computer

Tools - ***Arduino***: an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software

▄█ **Learning about Arduino** 
  
░░ **Experiments**: I followed the tutorials for several small projects, and gained basic understanding of the factors that Arduino can measure as well as different media of output.
  - Input: temperature, light intensity, vibration, body capacitance etc.
  - Output: physical display through lightbulbs, robotic arms; also in graphs, realized by connecting to other software, such as Processing.

░░ **Personal responses**: Posters inspired by the mechanical appearance of the device. Also a way to display its components<br/>

> **Device:** a vibrating device that translates the sequence to sensory feedback with captive proximity interactive function enabled by conducive prints. The Device was made of 12 vibration sensors that translates the pixel information of the video accordingly. It receives data from the capacitive sensor made from a foil or copper print, and controls the speed of video playback and vibration signal.

> **Animation:** used Unicode to encode typographic unicodes to play with perceptions and censorships. The Unicodes was curated from Chinese erotic idiom, decomposed by the python programme that was modified with an open-source library to make a typographical animation.<br/>

## Generative art


▄█ **What is generative art**

> “Generative art is art made using a predetermined system that often includes an element of chance – is usually applied to computer based art” – Tate art-term

> “Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.” - Philip Galanter

It is a method of creating artwork with programmed algorithms. Using languages such as JavaScript in p5.js, people can create visual works including interactive typography, textiles, 3D-printed furniture etc.

> 3D Data Sculpture piece, displayed on a 10 m x 10 m media wall, offers an immersive experience that taps into the random fluctuations of quantum noise as a realm of aesthetic possibilities.
  
> The project utilizes the Google AI’s quantum advantage research data and NVIDIA’s GAN algorithms by processing ~200 million photographs of nature through the lens of AI.

> Visualise and communicate the role of advanced technology within the modern drug development process.
>  
> The design married the clean and sterile 'tech' look with elegant organic motion. The eventual version took inspiration from genes and their classical depictions of discrete spheres of simple color.
  
> Technology: a combination of real-time and pathtraced rendering for different purposes. 
> -	data visualisation, look development and algorithmic prototyping: in-house creative coding tool Nodes
> -	complex simulation, geometry construction and final rendering: SideFX Houdini with Maxons Redshift renderer
